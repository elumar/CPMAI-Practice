CPMAI-P1-20250226-1842,Phase I - Business Understanding,1,Determine Business Objectives,1,"According to the CPMAI framework, which task is responsible for identifying the specific business metrics that will define project success?",Cost-Benefit Analysis,Determine Business Success Criteria,Business Feasibility,AI System Performance and Operation,B,Determine Business Success Criteria is the task specifically focused on defining the metrics and targets that indicate business objectives have been met.,"AI System Performance and Operation is tempting because it involves defining performance metrics, but those are technical and KPI thresholds - the task specifically responsible for identifying business success metrics is Determine Business Success Criteria.",
CPMAI-P1-20250226-2957,Phase I - Business Understanding,2,Cognitive Project Requirements,2,A project team is planning an AI initiative to automate customer service responses. They need to identify whether the solution requires natural language understanding or simple pattern matching. Which Phase I task addresses this specific need?,Assess Situation,Determine Business Objectives,AI Pattern Identification,Resource Requirements,C,AI Pattern Identification is the task within Cognitive Project Requirements that identifies the specific types of cognitive capabilities the AI solution needs.,"Assess Situation is tempting because it involves understanding context, but it focuses on resources and schedule, not cognitive requirements.",
CPMAI-P1-20250226-5123,Phase I - Business Understanding,2,Trustworthy AI Requirements,3,"A healthcare AI project team has documented Required Ethical AI Considerations, Required AI Transparency Considerations, Required AI Explainability Considerations, and Required Compliance With Regulations and Laws. The project sponsor asks whether they can move to Phase II. According to CPMAI, which additional Trustworthy AI task must be completed before the Go/No-Go decision?",Required AI Transparency Considerations,AI Failure Modes,Required AI Explainability Considerations,Required Compliance With Regulations and Laws,B,AI Failure Modes must be identified during Phase I to understand how the system could fail and what safeguards are needed before project approval.,"Required Compliance With Regulations and Laws is tempting because healthcare has strict regulations, but that task was explicitly completed in the scenario - AI Failure Modes is the only Trustworthy AI task not yet addressed.",
CPMAI-P1-20250226-6478,Phase I - Business Understanding,1,AI System Performance and Operation,4,Which two sets of performance values must be defined during Phase I according to the AI System Performance and Operation task group?,Training and Test Data Requirements,Acceptable Model Performance Values and Acceptable KPI Performance Values,Resource Requirements and Schedule Requirements,Cognitive Requirements and AI Pattern Identification,B,Acceptable Model Performance Values (technical) and Acceptable KPI Performance Values (business) are the two performance definition tasks in this task group.,"Training and Test Data Requirements is tempting but belongs to Phase II Data Understanding, not Phase I performance definition.",
CPMAI-P1-20250226-7231,Phase I - Business Understanding,3,AI Go/No-Go,5,"A project team has completed all Phase I tasks. Business feasibility is strong, and data appears available. However, the organization lacks data scientists with experience in the required technique. According to CPMAI, what is the correct outcome of the AI Go/No-Go task?",Proceed to Phase II - business and data feasibility are sufficient,Return to Determine Business Objectives to redefine the project scope,No-Go decision based on execution feasibility failure,Escalate to governance for a waiver to proceed without execution capability,C,Execution Feasibility is one of the three required feasibility assessments in the AI Go/No-Go task. Lack of skilled resources constitutes an execution feasibility failure.,"Proceed to Phase II is tempting because business and data feasibility are strong, but the Go/No-Go gate requires all three feasibility types (business, data, execution) to pass.","The critical distinction is that AI Go/No-Go requires three independent feasibility assessments - business, data, and execution - and all three must pass to proceed."
CPMAI-P1-20250226-3891,Phase I - Business Understanding,2,Trustworthy AI Requirements,6,"A financial services project team has documented the required model explainability approach and confirmed compliance with banking regulations. During review, a stakeholder asks how the team will handle situations where the model produces unexplainable results. Which Trustworthy AI requirement remains incomplete?",Required Ethical AI Considerations,Required AI Transparency Considerations,AI Failure Modes,Use of Trustworthy AI Framework,C,"AI Failure Modes requires identifying and planning for situations where the AI system fails or produces unexplainable results, which is precisely what the stakeholder is asking about.","Required AI Transparency Considerations is tempting because it relates to openness about how the model works, but failure modes specifically address what happens when things go wrong.",
CPMAI-P1-20250226-4562,Phase I - Business Understanding,1,Determine Business Objectives,7,"Within the Determine Business Objectives task group, which task directly precedes and informs the Cost-Benefit Analysis?",Assess Situation,Determine Business Objectives,Determine Business Success Criteria,Cognitive Project Requirements,B,"Determine Business Objectives establishes what the project aims to achieve, which is necessary input for calculating the costs and benefits of achieving those objectives.","Determine Business Success Criteria is tempting because it is sequentially adjacent to Cost-Benefit Analysis within the same task group, but it follows rather than precedes it - Determine Business Objectives establishes the goals that Cost-Benefit Analysis then evaluates.",
CPMAI-P1-20250226-5012,Phase I - Business Understanding,2,Assess Situation,8,"A project manager has identified that the AI initiative requires three data scientists and must be completed before the end of Q4. According to CPMAI, which Phase I task group is being executed?",Determine Business Objectives,Cognitive Project Requirements,Assess Situation,AI System Performance and Operation,C,"Assess Situation includes both Resource Requirements and Schedule Requirements tasks, which address staffing needs and timeline constraints.","AI System Performance and Operation is tempting because it involves defining performance values, but resource and schedule planning belong specifically to Assess Situation.",
CPMAI-P1-20250226-6345,Phase I - Business Understanding,1,Trustworthy AI Requirements,9,What is the priority level assigned to Trustworthy AI Requirements in the CPMAI framework?,Medium,High,Critical,Low,C,"Trustworthy AI Requirements is designated as Critical priority in the framework because it contains heavily tested CPMAI-specific concepts like ethics, explainability, and compliance.","High is tempting because many Phase I tasks are important, but the source material explicitly labels Trustworthy AI Requirements as Critical.",
CPMAI-P1-20250226-7128,Phase I - Business Understanding,3,Cognitive Project Requirements,10,A team has documented that their AI system needs to identify fraud patterns (pattern recognition) and recommend investigation priorities (decision support). The project manager believes this satisfies Cognitive Project Requirements. A reviewer disagrees. What is missing?,AI Pattern Identification - both requirements are patterns,The team has not identified whether the cognitive requirements are achievable with available data,The team should return to Phase II to confirm that available data supports both fraud pattern recognition and decision support before completing Cognitive Project Requirements,The team has not completed AI Pattern Identification and Cognitive Requirements as separate tasks - they have only done pattern identification,D,Cognitive Project Requirements is a task group containing two tasks: Cognitive Requirements (documenting all cognitive needs) and AI Pattern Identification (specifying pattern types). The team only performed pattern identification.,"Option B is tempting because data availability is always relevant, but the reviewer's concern is a Phase I task completion issue - Cognitive Project Requirements contains two separate tasks and the gap is incomplete Phase I documentation, not a data availability question requiring Phase II.",The distinction is that Cognitive Project Requirements is a task group containing two separate tasks; completing one does not complete the task group.
CPMAI-P1-20250226-8234,Phase I - Business Understanding,1,AI Go/No-Go,11,Which three feasibility assessments are required in the AI Go/No-Go task?,"Technical, Operational, and Financial","Business, Data, and Execution","Resource, Schedule, and Budget","Model, Data, and Infrastructure",B,"The AI Go/No-Go task explicitly requires Business Feasibility, Data Feasibility, and Execution Feasibility assessments.","Technical, Operational, and Financial is tempting because these are common project feasibility dimensions, but CPMAI specifies the three listed in the framework.",
CPMAI-P1-20250226-9456,Phase I - Business Understanding,2,Determine Business Objectives,12,"A retail company wants to use AI to reduce inventory waste. The project team defines success as ""fewer write-offs"" but cannot quantify the target. According to CPMAI, what is the primary issue with this approach?",The team skipped Cost-Benefit Analysis,The team has not defined measurable Business Success Criteria,The team should have started with Cognitive Project Requirements,The team needs to complete Assess Situation first,B,"Determine Business Success Criteria requires specific, measurable targets. ""Fewer write-offs"" is not measurable without a baseline and target percentage or value.","The team skipped Cost-Benefit Analysis is tempting because cost-benefit is important, but the immediate gap is the lack of measurable success criteria to inform that analysis.",
CPMAI-P1-20250226-2671,Phase I - Business Understanding,1,AI System Performance and Operation,13,"According to the framework, what is the purpose of defining Acceptable Model Performance Values during Phase I?",To set technical accuracy thresholds that the model must meet during evaluation,To determine which algorithm to use in Phase IV,To establish data quality requirements for Phase II,To calculate the ROI of the AI investment,A,"Acceptable Model Performance Values define the technical thresholds (accuracy, precision, recall, etc.) that the model must achieve, linking Phase I business goals to Phase V evaluation.","To determine which algorithm to use in Phase IV is tempting because performance relates to algorithm choice, but the purpose is setting evaluation thresholds, not selecting techniques.",
CPMAI-P1-20250226-1539,Phase I - Business Understanding,2,Trustworthy AI Requirements,14,A team building a hiring assistant AI has documented compliance with equal opportunity laws and defined how the model's decisions will be explained to candidates. A compliance officer asks how the team will ensure candidates know they are interacting with an AI. Which Trustworthy AI requirement addresses this?,Required AI Transparency Considerations,Required AI Explainability Considerations,Required Ethical AI Considerations,AI Failure Modes,A,Required AI Transparency Considerations addresses disclosure that an AI system is being used and openness about system capabilities and limitations.,"Required AI Explainability Considerations is tempting because it relates to explaining decisions, but transparency specifically covers disclosure of AI presence and system boundaries.",
CPMAI-P1-20250226-6782,Phase I - Business Understanding,3,AI Go/No-Go,15,"A project passes Business Feasibility and Execution Feasibility. Data Feasibility is marginal - the available data has significant gaps but could potentially be augmented. The sponsor wants to proceed to Phase II to ""explore data options."" What does CPMAI indicate?",Proceed - Phase II is exactly where data exploration occurs,No-Go - Data Feasibility must pass before leaving Phase I,Proceed with a conditional approval and data quality checkpoint,Return to Determine Business Objectives to scope down the project,B,The AI Go/No-Go gate requires all three feasibility assessments to pass before exiting Phase I. Marginal data feasibility constitutes a failure of Data Feasibility.,"Proceed - Phase II is exactly where data exploration occurs is the trap answer - while Phase II does explore data, the Go/No-Go gate must be passed to enter Phase II, and it requires feasibility confirmation, not exploration commitment.","The distinction is that Data Feasibility in Phase I asks ""can we get sufficient data?"" while Phase II Data Understanding asks ""what exactly is in the data we have?"" - feasibility must be confirmed before exploration begins."
CPMAI-P1-20250226-3348,Phase I - Business Understanding,1,Cognitive Project Requirements,16,"Which task group in Phase I is specifically responsible for identifying whether the AI solution requires perception, reasoning, or natural language capabilities?",Determine Business Objectives,Assess Situation,Cognitive Project Requirements,Trustworthy AI Requirements,C,"Cognitive Project Requirements contains AI Pattern Identification, which identifies the specific cognitive capabilities the AI solution requires.","Determine Business Objectives is tempting because objectives inform requirements, but the specific identification of cognitive capability types belongs to Cognitive Project Requirements.",

Which two Assess Situation tasks are being performed?,Determine Business Objectives and Cost-Benefit Analysis,Resource Requirements and Schedule Requirements,Data Feasibility and Business Feasibility,AI Pattern Identification and Cognitive Requirements,B,"Resource Requirements covers needs like specialized data access, and Schedule Requirements covers timeline constraints like the shareholder meeting deadline.","Data Feasibility and Business Feasibility is tempting because these are feasibility types, but the scenario describes resource needs and timeline, which belong to Assess Situation tasks.",
CPMAI-P1-20250226-4087,Phase I - Business Understanding,1,Trustworthy AI Requirements,18,"According to the framework, which Trustworthy AI task ensures the project has identified relevant laws and regulations that apply to the AI system?",Required Ethical AI Considerations,Required AI Transparency Considerations,Required Compliance With Regulations and Laws,AI Failure Modes,C,Required Compliance With Regulations and Laws is the specific task addressing legal and regulatory requirements for the AI system.,"Required Ethical AI Considerations is tempting because ethics and compliance are related, but they are separate tasks addressing different concerns.",
CPMAI-P1-20250226-5753,Phase I - Business Understanding,2,Determine Business Objectives,19,"A manufacturing company wants to implement predictive maintenance. The team documents that the objective is to ""reduce unplanned downtime."" During review, a stakeholder asks how much reduction is enough and how it will be measured. Which Determine Business Objectives subtask is missing?",Determine Business Objectives,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Determine Business Success Criteria,Business Feasibility,C,Determine Business Success Criteria establishes the specific metrics and targets that define whether the business objective has been achieved.,"Determine Business Objectives is tempting because it sounds like the same thing, but the task group contains separate subtasks: setting the objective and defining how success is measured.",
CPMAI-P1-20250226-6681,Phase I - Business Understanding,3,AI System Performance and Operation,20,"A project team has defined Acceptable Model Performance Values at 95% accuracy. They have not defined Acceptable KPI Performance Values, arguing that KPIs will be addressed in Phase V during KPI Measurement. According to CPMAI, is this approach correct?","Yes - KPIs are measured in Phase V, so defining them in Phase I is premature",No - both model performance and KPI performance values must be defined in Phase I,Yes - model performance values are the only performance definition needed in Phase I,No - KPI values should be defined in Phase II during Data Understanding,B,AI System Performance and Operation requires defining both Acceptable Model Performance Values and Acceptable KPI Performance Values during Phase I to link technical and business success criteria from the start.,"Yes - KPIs are measured in Phase V, so defining them in Phase I is premature is the trap - while KPI Measurement occurs in Phase V, the target values for those KPIs must be established in Phase I to guide the entire project.","The distinction is between setting performance targets (Phase I) and measuring actual performance against those targets (Phase V) - both are required, and they occur in different phases."
